# Histopathology Image Analysis for Cancer Grading using CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze histopathology images and automatically detect and classify cancer severity. The model helps in identifying different cancer grades from medical images, improving accuracy and supporting early diagnosis through an AI-based approach.
